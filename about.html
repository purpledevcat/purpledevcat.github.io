<div class="pdc-article-text">Hello world! I am a software developer currently reading for an MSc in Computer Games Technology at Abertay University in Dundee. I have been programming professionally since I earned my undergraduate degree in computer science in 2014. The idea of one day making games was what originally drove me to start programming. Unfortunately, the games industry doesn't really have a presence in Malta, where I am from. Because of this, I have not had the opportunity to work in the games industry yet, but I am now determined to change that!</div>
<div class="pdc-article-text">My colleagues have described me as someone who loves technical challenges and delivers on them, has a fantastic eye for quality code, understands issues and is good at communicating technical solutions to both technical and non technical colleagues, and is always happy.</div>
