	<p>Hello world! I am a software developer currently working at the Boss Alien game studio in Brighton. This is my first job in the games industry, although I have been programming professionally since I earned my undergraduate degree in computer science in 2014. The idea of one day making games was what originally drove me to start programming.</p>
	<p>My colleagues have described me as someone who loves technical challenges and delivers on them, has a fantastic eye for quality code, understands issues and is good at communicating technical solutions to both technical and non technical colleagues, and is always happy.</p>
