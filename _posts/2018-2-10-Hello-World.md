Hello reader! Welcome to Purple Dev Cat!

You must be thinking, what is this website all about? A fair question, given that this post is, at the time of this writing, literally the only piece of content on here, but I'm hoping for that to change soon.

Well, I think that you will get the gist of it if I share with you my current personal goals for my professional development.
- I want to commit myself to keep learning new things.
- I want to document the things that I learn.

In case the Dev in Purple Dev Cat didn't make it perfectly clear, I am a software developer, so... I guess we can call this a tech blog! If I can keep up my own personal commitments, and the content here ever helps anyone out, even if it is just my future self trying to remember something I used to know, I will call this time well spent.
