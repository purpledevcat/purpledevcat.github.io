            Goop is a game that I built in approximately 3 weeks for the 2019 edition of the Search for a Star game development competition for students. It is built using Unity, and my primary aim for the project was to create a game that, although small in scope, looks and feels polished and well put together. Apart from that, I wanted to try to cover as much of the gameplay as I could manage with automated tests. The game was very well received by the industry judges, who noted that it could easily be releasable with a little extra polish.

            This is a simple 3D scene rendered using DirectX 11 visualizing a pulsar pattern in a Game of Life simulation. Though the scene itself is quite simple, alot of work went into setting it up. The main aims of the project were to setup a basic 3D rendering framework with an API that would allow a scene to be defined with the ease of creating one in something like Unity, and where the rendering code was decoupled from the simulation code. Models are loaded from standard .obj files.
