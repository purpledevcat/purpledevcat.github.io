            Goop is a game that was built in approximately 3 weeks for the 2019 edition of the Search for a Star game development competition for students. It is built using Unity, and my primary aim for the project was to create a game that, although small in scope, looks and feels polished and well put together. Apart from that, I wanted to try to cover as much of the gameplay as I could manage with automated tests.
